# Indizr Weekly (Deprecated)

This is a collection of the HTML for Indizr Weekly, a free email newsletter about digital news innovation that ran from July 2017 to May 2018.

The newsletter is now deprecated, so this repo is effectively a complete archive.

As a successor project, the newsletter's publisher has begun sending e-mail updates on a more occasional basis, with a focus on internet decentralization. You can subscribe to those updates if you're interested at https://indizr.com/newsletter
